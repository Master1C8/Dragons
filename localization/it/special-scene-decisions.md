# Italian special-scene decisions

Binding: paired English worklist SHA-256 `692c32667546db79d51cab95d4894bb97f7f78b4fda0756465f90c0a5e6319d2`; Italian glossary SHA-256 `d069f575030d7f60b63d91c6596a0cfafaab55f36b42728918633082f5fdc037`. Source registries and hashes are bound by the worklist special-scene index. These are author decisions and self-review, not the independent final game-text audit. Source IDs retain the prefix `yarn:line:`. Accepted wording here is preparatory and is not yet inserted into a package.

## Alexander's proletarian register

Source case `alexander-proletarian-register`, registry SHA-256 `72f5dfa5d8ba396d92c7bf67c6912d05022940f2197e073b0a651b5e7f5b0809`. Both builds have the same meaning despite the Windows spelling of “environment”. The elevated word and the interrupted attempt to repeat it must match; Alexander's apology moves to a plain compliment. Author self-review: the seven target lines preserve the class contrast, confused question, separate polite path and convergence.

| ID | Italian wording |
|---|---|
| `73e4789c` | Sai... Questo ambiente è piuttosto piacevole. Molto... proletario. |
| `e5d47feb` | prole- <i><size=70%>come? |
| `8512365e` | Grazie! |
| `74c9c07b` | Oh, cioè... della classe operaia? |
| `e2f9c70c` | Scusa, volevo dire che mi piace il tuo servizio di lavaggio. |
| `13223129` | Ma certo |
| `a97338b0` | Chi avrebbe mai detto che posti simili fossero così facilmente accessibili al pubblico! |

Use the original ID and stock dialogue mapping; the existing text path accepts the same ordered `<i><size=70%>` tags. Positive: choice `e5d47feb` goes to stock destination 11 and receives the class clarification and apology; `8512365e` goes to 15 and receives the public-access comment. Negative: a different interrupted root, swapped destinations, or removed markup fails. Editorial: author-reviewed. Adapter feasibility: bounded paired renderer and source mapping passed; implementation/structural validation against the authored package, runtime and final visual fit: pending.

## Conrad's scales aside

Source case `conrad-scales-aside`, registry SHA-256 `792cd452b62853213499c2d167254db77907f1de652cf7cba076f386653380c7`, row `6c193ba9` (same English on both builds):

> Scaglie diverse oggi? <size=70%><i>è possibile...? </i><size=100%>Oggi stai bene.

Author self-review: the smaller hesitant aside questions whether scales can change; the compliment returns to normal size. Preserve the exact tag order and three nonempty regions with the original source ID. Positive: the middle region alone uses the smaller italic source treatment, then the compliment returns to 100%; negative: an empty aside or moved size boundary fails. Editorial: author-reviewed. Adapter feasibility: existing TMP text path and structural guard; package implementation and validation, actual runtime and visual fit: pending.

## Ryan branch hesitation sizing

Source case `ryan-branch-hesitation-sizing`, same typography registry, row `9fd5b834` (same English on both builds):

> Sì. <size=90%>Oh- <size=80%>sai, io... <size=70%>Ahah. Sì. Mhm!

Author self-review: successive hesitant beats retain the increasingly small voice without assigning the player's gender. Keep the original choice identity, destination, and 90%, 80%, 70% order and nonempty stages. Positive: each beat remains in its original size stage; negative: an empty stage, reordered tags or changed choice destination fails. Editorial: author-reviewed. Adapter feasibility: existing TMP text path and structural guard; package implementation and validation, runtime and visual fit: pending.

## Gate status

Three of 27 cases have author-reviewed wording recorded above; the remaining 24 require complete contextual decisions. Several cases overlap: when their complete groups are reviewed, reconcile any shared IDs with the accepted wording here and reopen affected decisions if wording must change. No ordinary translation has begun. Final implementation, package, runtime and visual checks remain separate.
